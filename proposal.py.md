# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO
The best Tic tac toe
## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

TODO
This project will be a tic tac toe game where two player will be able to play back and forth with each other.
The other will be a Tkinter tic tac toe game which will make it look nicer with a user interface

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

TODO
The first tic tac toe game will be just be a python code that executes two player taking turn to play tic tac toe to find a winner.
The tkinter one will be simillar just with this software installed as well.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

TODO
The good outcome of my final project would be if i am able to finish just the first tic tac toe game without the tkinter user interface tool.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO
If i am able to have some of the tkinter interface working with a game board and almost able to play.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO
The best out come will be if bothe my codes work and are able to execute the functions properly.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

TODO
My next steps would be to read and watch videos on how people are able to use the tkinter interface tool in python and how they get it to work and then think of a way to include that with my tic tac toe game.
