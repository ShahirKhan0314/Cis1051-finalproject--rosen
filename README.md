Questions and Answers about the Final Project:
For TictacToe_final.py:
  The main challenges for my tic ttac toe base game were coming up with the if elif statments that i used and how to manage each spot on the gamboard as a number instead of making it choose a collum and row for 'X' or 'O'. The way I overcame this obstacle was i saww someone in the links i supported that used a kind of coordinate system to label the 9 spaces in a tic tac toe game. This is the end made my code alot easier and i was able to use it with more efficently.
